# beer-style-classification
Using data from Kaggle on Homebrewed Beer Recipe data, we attempt to predict the style of each beer based on physical characteristic of the recipe (ABV, IBUs, etc.). This is a classification problem with a high number of classes, and we try a variety of different models to predict the style of beer (logistic regression, kNN, RandomForests).
